abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic shocked the economy of China in early 2020.
  Strict lockdown measures were implemented nationwide to prevent the further
  spread of the virus. During the lockdown period, many economic activities were
  affected, which had repercussions for the nation's overall employment.
  Vocational graduates were among the most affected by the crisis. To estimate
  the causal effects of COVID-19 on the full-time employment of vocational high
  school graduates as well as their monthly income and hours worked by week, we
  exploit variations in the intensity of the pandemic in time and across space
  using survey data from vocational schools from six provinces in China. The
  results of the difference-in-differences (DID) estimates indicate that being
  located in counties with high pandemic intensity significantly reduced both
  the employment in full-time jobs of vocational graduates as well as their
  monthly income. Our study's analysis demonstrates that the effects of COVID-19
  on the labor market can be attributed to the large-scale contraction of labor
  demand of the enterprises that were hiring vocational graduates. To cope with
  this situation, vocational graduates took various measures, including reducing
  consumption, drawing on their savings, searching for new jobs, taking on
  part-time jobs, borrowing money, and attending new training programs. In
  addition, the empirical analysis finds that there were heterogeneous effects
  with respect to gender, family social capital, the industry in which the
  vocational graduate was participating, and whether the individual was in a
  management position.
