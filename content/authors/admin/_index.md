I am a Ph.D. student in Agricultural Economics at Peking University, and currently a visiting student researcher at Stanford University. 

My research interests lie in labor economics and education economics, with a particular focus on vocational education in China. In my future work, I aim to evaluate the effects of different educational tracks and modules within vocational education (such as workplace learning programs) on individuals' labor market outcomes using longitudinal data.
