I am a Ph.D. student in Agricultural Economics at Peking University, and currently a visiting student researcher at Stanford Univeristy. 

My work focuses on labor economics and education economics, especially about vocational education in China. In my future research, I plan to assess the impact of education tracks and specific module in vocational education (e.g., workplace learning program) on individuals' labor market outcomes using longitudinal data.
